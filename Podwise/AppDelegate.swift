//    alert. This can be a string, like in the previous example, or a dictionary itself. As a dictionary, it can localize the text or change other aspects of the notification.
//    badge. This is a number that will display in the corner of the app icon. You can remove the badge by setting this to 0.
//    thread-id. You may use this key for grouping notifications.
//    sound. By setting this key, you can play custom notification sounds located in the app in place of the default notification sound. Custom notification sounds must be shorter than 30 seconds and have a few restrictions.
//    content-available. By setting this key to 1, the push notification becomes a silent one. This will be explored later in this push notifications tutorial.
//    category. This defines the category of the notification, which is is used to show custom actions on the notification. You will also be exploring this shortly.
